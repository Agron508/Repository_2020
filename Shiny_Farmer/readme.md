**Description**:
This tool displays a visual representation of **P**otential **E**vapo**t**ranspiration (**PET**) and actual **ET** (which depends on the crop stage), and the consequences on soil water in the top 20 cm of the profile.

* The **PET** for a given *month* and *year (2012-2019)* at the Agronomy Research Farm near Ames Iowa comes from the [Iowa Environmental Mesonet](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/agclimate/hist/dailyRequest.php). 
* The [Crop Coefficient Help](https://cropwatch.unl.edu/estimating-crop-evapotranspiration) provides guidance on picking a value based on the crop's growth stage. 
The ET depends on the *Crop Coefficient Kc* via:
<div align="center">*actual ET = Kc x PET*
* The [Soil Water Visual](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/soil-water-dynamics-103089121/) provides soil water benchmarks. The **maximum water content of this soil is 50% by volume**, which corresponds to complete saturation. 
* The [Plant Wilting Point Help](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/soil-water-dynamics-103089121/) provides guidance on picking a value based on soil type.


This tool could allow growers to determine times of potential stress to the crop based on weather conditions. Currently, it simply demonstrates how rapidly crops can become water stressed.
